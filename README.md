Spotify personal projects

The intent of this projects are:
1. To be able to get the streaming data (in trajectory over time) of a particular song or artist from the official Spotify charts website.
2. Using this data, to evaluate whether a song appearance in Spotify Global Top 50 tracklist will help boost the performance of the song. On Spotify, 50 songs with the highest streams daily will be featured in Global Top 50 Chart Playlist. Spotify users may check out new entries in Top 50 and play the song (thereâ€™s a mark for the song which just climbed to Top 50). Does the appearance of the song in the chart help boost its performance?
