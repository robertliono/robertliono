Personal projects - Spotify streams count

The intent of the code is to get daily Spotify streaming number for any particular song by any particular artist (with function: get_data_track(track, artist)) or by any particular artist (with function: get_data_artist(artist)).
It will pull daily stream number for 2 years (730 days) and plot the streams vs time.
The number is obtained from this official Spotify chart: https://spotifycharts.com/regional/global/daily/latest
